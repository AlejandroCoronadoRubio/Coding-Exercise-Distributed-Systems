Exercise Details:

Problem Statement: You are provided with two arrays of unique integers, each containing elements with indices ranging from 0 to Integer.MAX_VALUE-1. Your task is to identify and return the indices of any two elements whose sum equals a given input_sum. If no such pair exists, please return -1, -1.

Example:

Array One: [9, 5, 0, -1]
Array Two: [8, 11, 2, 17]
Input Sum: 7
Expected Output: 3, 0
Explanation: The sum of -1 (from Array One) and 8 (from Array Two) equals 7. The indices of these elements are 3 and 0, respectively.*

Extension: For an enhanced challenge, please solve the same problem with the assumption that both arrays are already sorted.

Example:

Array One: [-1, 0, 5, 9]
Array Two: [2, 8, 11, 17]
Input Sum: 7
Expected Output: 0, 1
Explanation: The sum of -1 (from Array One) and 8 (from Array Two) equals 7. The indices of these elements are 0 and 1, respectively.*
