Exercise Details:<br />

Problem Statement: You are provided with two arrays of unique integers, each containing elements with indices ranging from 0 to Integer.MAX_VALUE-1. Your task is to identify and return the indices of any two elements whose sum equals a given input_sum. If no such pair exists, please return -1, -1.<br />

Example:<br />

Array One: [9, 5, 0, -1]<br />
Array Two: [8, 11, 2, 17]<br />
Input Sum: 7<br />
Expected Output: 3, 0<br />
Explanation: The sum of -1 (from Array One) and 8 (from Array Two) equals 7. The indices of these elements are 3 and 0, respectively.*<br />

Extension: For an enhanced challenge, please solve the same problem with the assumption that both arrays are already sorted.<br />

Example:<br />

Array One: [-1, 0, 5, 9]<br />
Array Two: [2, 8, 11, 17]<br />
Input Sum: 7<br />
Expected Output: 0, 1<br />
Explanation: The sum of -1 (from Array One) and 8 (from Array Two) equals 7. The indices of these elements are 0 and 1, respectively.*<br />
